# Fantasy Golf Website: 

* "User Login/Registration page", Site is Password protected. One password to the distribution list when I send out the initial email and then can provide a new password to the people that actually join the pool. When a person enters a team they provide their email address, which we can store.
 
* “Team Building Page”, allows users to create a team of x golfers within budget parameters. Users can build several teams at the same time so they can compare and then choose from among them.
 
* “Standings Page”, containing standings of each team performance. This page will be updated based on manual input of individual players’ performance. Ideally, this pulls live scores periodically (or on the click of a button) to refreash standings.
 
* “Blog Page”, where commentary can be posted by Admin user.
 
Admin User functionality with Abilities: (1) Change Budget Parameters (2) Manage Users. (3) Update Golfers performance, which will update standings page (4) Post on “Blog page”.
